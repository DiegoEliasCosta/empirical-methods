(thanks for the promo, [@JoshQuicksall](https://twitter.com/JoshQuicksall)!)

## Overview

Empirical methods play a key role in the evaluation of tools and technologies, 
and in testing the social and technical theories they embody. No matter what 
your research area is, chances are you will be conducing empirical studies as 
part of your research. Are you looking to evaluate a new algorithm? New tool? 
Analyze (big) data? Understand what challenges practitioners face in some domain? 
This course is a survey of empirical methods, appropriate for all computer 
science PhD students, including [Software Engineering](https://se-phd.isri.cmu.edu) 
and [Societal Computing](http://sc.isri.cmu.edu).

This course provides an overview and hands on experience with a core of 
qualitative and quantitative empirical research methods, including interviews, 
qualitative coding, survey design, and large-scale mining and analysis of data. 
Students will mine and integrate data from and across online software repositories 
(e.g., GitHub and Stack Overflow) and employ a spectrum of data analysis 
techniques, ranging from statistical modeling to social network analysis.

There will be extensive reading with occasional student presentations about 
the reading in class, weekly homework assignments, and a semester-long research 
project for which students must prepare in-class kickoff and final presentations 
as well as a final report.

After completing this course, you will:

-  become a more sophisticated consumer of empirical research, both in your field and outside
-  develop the methodological skills that can help you design and carry out empirical components in your own research program
-  be able to analyze empirical data, draw conclusions, and present results 
-  be able to read, summarize, and present academic papers

### Course Syllabus and Policies
The [syllabus](syllabus.md) covers course overview and objectives, evaluation, 
time management, late work policy, and collaboration policy.

### Learning Goals
The [learning goals](learning-goals.md) describe what I want students to know 
or be able to do by the end of the semester. 
I evaluate whether learning goals have been achieved through assignments, 
written project reports, and in-class presentations.

### Readings

#### Introduction (8/30)

We will start out by looking broadly over the range of empirical methods you might consider using, and the assumptions and philosophical points of view they rely on. We also want to hear about the kinds of research problems you are working on or plan to work on, and the sorts of empirical questions they give rise to. Please be prepared to share this with the class, as it will help us to have fruitful discussions if we know a little about each others' research areas. We will also use the information to customize the course a bit to emphasize things for which there is a clear need.
