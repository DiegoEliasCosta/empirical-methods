## Overview

Empirical methods play a key role in the evaluation of tools and technologies, and in testing the social and technical theories they embody. No matter what your research area is, chances are you will be conducing empirical studies as part of your research. Are you looking to evaluate a new algorithm? New tool? Analyze (big) data? Understand what challenges practitioners face in some domain? This course is a survey of empirical methods, appropriate for all computer science PhD students, including Software Engineering and Societal Computing.

This course provides an overview and hands on experience with a core of qualitative and quantitative empirical research methods, including interviews, qualitative coding, survey design, and large-scale mining and analysis of data. Students will mine and integrate data from and across online software repositories (e.g., GitHub and Stack Overflow) and employ a spectrum of data analysis techniques, ranging from statistical modeling to social network analysis.

There will be extensive reading with occasional student presentations about the reading in class, weekly homework assignments, and a semester-long research project for which students must prepare in-class kickoff and final presentations as well as a final report.

After completing this course, you will:

-  become a more sophisticated consumer of empirical research, both in your field and outside
-  develop the methodological skills that can help you design and carry out empirical components in your own research program
-  be able to analyze empirical data, draw conclusions, and present results 
-  be able to read, summarize, and present academic papers

### Course Syllabus and Policies
The [syllabus](syllabus.md) covers course overview and objectives, evaluation, time management, late work policy, and collaboration policy.

### Learning Goals
The [learning goals](learning-goals.md) describe what I want students to know or be able to do by the end of the semester. I evaluate whether learning goals have been achieved through assignments, written project reports, and in-class presentations.


### Tentative Schedule

While the exact schedule is still subject to change, I expect we will cover the following:
